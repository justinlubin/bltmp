            <p>
                The Bioinformatics Long-Term Mentoring Program (BLTMP) pairs
                wet lab biologists with bioinformaticians for long-term (1+
                year) mentorship.
            </p>

            <p>
                A long line of research
                [<a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/0013161X04267118">1</a>,
                <a href="https://doi.org/10.17226/25568">2</a>]
                shows that we all benefit from a variety of mentors, including
                personal mentors, academic mentors, and so on. The BLTMP
                provides bioinformatics mentorship for technical, career, and
                personal topics.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Technical mentorship can include how to acquire skills in
                    programming, statistics, or computational biology.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Career mentorship can include how to land a new job or
                    decide between career paths.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Personal mentorship can include support for going through
                    the struggles of learning, job hunting, or beyond.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                The goals of this program are:
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li>To help wet lab biologists learn bioinformatics skills that aid their research.</p>
                <li>To provide a source of general career and personal mentorship for wet lab biologists.</p>
            </ol>

            <h2>How it works</h2>

            <p>
                BLTMP matches wet lab biology mentees with volunteer
                bioinformatics mentors. Ideally, this relationship should last
                for at least one year, with at least monthly meetings. The
                exact logistics of the mentoring relationship are up to the
                mentor and mentee.
            </p>

            <p>
                Mentees can ask for advice of all forms.  As part of this
                relationship, mentees can bring their wet lab data, and mentors
                advise them on how to analyze it, including:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Resources to learn programming, debugging, and computational biology.</li>
                <li>Advice on what computational steps to run in a workflow.</li>
                <li>Help with specific technical issues.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Mentees should <b>not</b> expect their mentor to do their work
                for them. <b>Mentees bring and lead their own projects.</b> The
                goal of the mentor is to teach the mentee how to successfully
                apply bioinformatics skills, not to do their bioinformatics
                analyses for them.
            </p>

            <p class="important">
                <span>Important!</span>
                By default, mentors are <b>not</b> presumed to be co-authors on
                any publication the mentee is working on. Mentors should only
                provide advice they feel comfortable providing under this
                pretext. Please have authorship conversations early and often.
            </p>

            <h2>Information about the organizing committee</h2>

            <p>
                Currently, the organizing committee is just me:
                <a href="https://jlubin.net/">Justin Lubin</a>!
                I am a PhD candidate in computer science at UC Berkeley. I work
                closely with wet lab biologists to co-design programming
                systems for folks without programming expertise.
